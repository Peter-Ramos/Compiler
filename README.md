# Interprented programming language

Welcome to the project. I hope you like the personal project i am creating

**Personal goals:**
- Manage to understand more about programming languages i am working wiht like python and java and get a deep dive into how (simplified) they process my code and turn it into machine code so that it can run
- Manage to use better Git, C and Nvim for future works and self improvement
- Have fun 😁 (Should not overthink this) 

# Structure 
Goal is to create a language with an interpreter

there are basically a few parts i have to create for the program
1. Tokenizer 
2. Parser
3. Compiler (which is plit to more)
4. Interpreter

How should this language look like ?
